This is a repo for when you need to get a react/redux app to consume and interact with a pre-existing api (documentation for api here: http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/).

Instructions:

Clone or download app.  run 'npm i' in the directory that contains package.json file, then run 'npm start'.  Now you have a front-end that can get/post/delete an api.
